Bootstrap-Datagrid
==================

Bootstrap Datagrid - Forked from FuelUX, they provided a reasonable start to making a nice bootstrap datagrid plugin.

Some of the noticeable enahancements are:
 1) Binding arbitrary function calls passed in to the options configuration by string.
 2) Setting style attributes of the columns e.g. even/odd and alignments.
 
Currently in progress:
 1) (JSON) Data Store functionality e.g. Add, modify, delete.
 2) Inline editing.
 3) Whatever other useful functionality I need for my project.
